This a P5 js version of A* Algrithm Visualization.\
I wanted to make something different than other visualizations in it.\
So this examples use nodes instead of grid visualizations.\

To create the map follow the steps:-\
1.Add a starting point\
 - Select start from the dropdown menu\
 - Click on the canvas to add the point\
2.Add an ending point\
 - Select end from the dropdown menu\
 - Click on the canvas to add the point\
3.Add other nodes\
 - Select normal from the dropdown menu\
 - Click on the canvas to add the point\
4.Connecting the points\
 - Click on the two ellipses one at a time to create a path between them\
5.Finding the path\
 - Click the find the path button to start the algorithm\
 - The optimal path is found in purple colour\
