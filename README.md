This a P5 js version of A* Algrithm Visualization.\n
I wanted to make something different than other visualizations in it.\n
So this examples use nodes instead of grid visualizations.\n

To create the map follow the steps:-\n
1.Add a starting point\n
 - Select start from the dropdown menu\n
 - Click on the canvas to add the point\n
2.Add an ending point\n
 - Select end from the dropdown menu\n
 - Click on the canvas to add the point\n
3.Add other nodes\n
 - Select normal from the dropdown menu\n
 - Click on the canvas to add the point\n
4.Connecting the points\n
 - Click on the two ellipses one at a time to create a path between them\n
5.Finding the path\n
 - Click the find the path button to start the algorithm\n
 - The optimal path is found in purple colour\n
